*The Lean Startup* by Eric Ries presents a systematic approach to building successful startups through continuous innovation and validated learning. It emphasizes creating a “minimum viable product” (MVP) to test ideas quickly, gather feedback, and adapt based on real customer responses rather than assumptions. Ries introduces the “Build-Measure-Learn” feedback loop to help entrepreneurs pivot or persevere efficiently. The book promotes lean thinking, agile development, and data-driven decision-making to reduce waste and maximize impact. By focusing on rapid experimentation and customer needs, *The Lean Startup* teaches how to turn vision into a sustainable, scalable business in uncertain markets.
