*Atomic Habits* by James Clear explores how small, consistent changes can lead to remarkable personal and professional growth. Clear introduces the concept of “atomic habits”—tiny behaviors that compound over time—and provides a framework called the Four Laws of Behavior Change: Make it Obvious, Make it Attractive, Make it Easy, and Make it Satisfying. The book emphasizes the power of systems over goals, identity-based habits, and the role of environment in shaping behavior. Through practical strategies and real-life examples, Clear shows how breaking bad habits and building good ones can transform life. Ultimately, it teaches that tiny improvements, repeated consistently, create massive results.
