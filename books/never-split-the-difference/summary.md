*Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss reveals negotiation techniques based on the author’s experience as an FBI hostage negotiator. The book emphasizes emotional intelligence, empathy, and active listening over logic or compromise. Voss introduces strategies like “tactical empathy,” mirroring, labeling emotions, and using calibrated questions to build trust and influence outcomes. He argues that “splitting the difference” often leads to subpar results, encouraging negotiators to seek win-win solutions through understanding and persuasion. The book blends psychology, storytelling, and practical tools to help readers negotiate effectively in business, relationships, and everyday life.
