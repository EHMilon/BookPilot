*Ego Is the Enemy* by Ryan Holiday explores how ego—our false sense of importance and entitlement—can sabotage success, growth, and peace of mind. Through historical examples and philosophical insights, Holiday shows how humility, discipline, and self-awareness lead to true achievement. The book is divided into three stages—Aspire, Success, and Failure—illustrating how ego can distort our thinking at each stage of life. He encourages readers to focus on purpose over recognition, learning over pride, and service over self-importance. Ultimately, *Ego Is the Enemy* teaches that conquering ego is essential to mastering oneself and achieving lasting fulfillment.
