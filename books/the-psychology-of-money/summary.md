*The Psychology of Money* by Morgan Housel explores how emotions, behavior, and perception shape financial decisions more than knowledge or intelligence. Through stories and insights, Housel explains that wealth is not about income but about habits like saving, patience, and risk management. He highlights that luck, timing, and personal experiences heavily influence financial outcomes. The book emphasizes humility, long-term thinking, and contentment over greed or comparison. Key lessons include the importance of financial independence, avoiding lifestyle inflation, and understanding that moneyâ€™s greatest value is the freedom it provides. Ultimately, it teaches that managing money well is more about mindset than math.
