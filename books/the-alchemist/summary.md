*The Alchemist* by Paulo Coelho follows Santiago, a young Andalusian shepherd who dreams of finding a hidden treasure near the Egyptian pyramids. Guided by recurring dreams and a mysterious king named Melchizedek, Santiago sells his flock and begins a journey across the desert in search of his Personal Legend—the purpose meant for his life. Along the way, he works for a crystal merchant, learns from an Englishman studying alchemy, and meets the wise Alchemist who teaches him to listen to his heart and understand the “Language of the World.” Through trials of love, faith, and perseverance, Santiago discovers that true treasure lies not in gold but in self-discovery and spiritual enlightenment. Ultimately, he learns that the treasure he sought was buried at his original home, symbolizing that the greatest journeys lead us back to ourselves.
